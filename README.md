This repository contains the files use to build the Rhendraring. A personal [webring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring) containing sites of a small Indonesian furry programmers friend group (along with some non Indonesians and non furs).

This webring is based on [Viatrix's Jekyll webring tutorial](https://vivivi.leprd.space/webmastery/webring/) and is hosted on netlify.
